# DECKARD: Automation Framework

Welcome to **DECKARD**, an advanced automation framework designed to streamline the testing of breakpoints, styles, and other visual elements across various devices and screen sizes.

## What Does DECKARD Do?

DECKARD automatically checks your web sites blocks for responsiveness and style consistency across breakpoints. With every test run, the framework ensures:

-   **Breakpoint validation**: Detects layout issues across different screen sizes.
-   **Style checks**: Verifies that CSS properties remain consistent with your design.
-   **Screenshot on failure**: Captures visual evidence of failures to aid in debugging.
-   **Detailed reporting**: Logs all issues in a comprehensive report for easy tracking and resolution.

## How DECKARD Works

1. DECKARD inspects predefined breakpoints and styles.
2. It runs through various device emulations to ensure layout consistency.
3. On detecting a failure (e.g., a style mismatch or layout issue), it takes a screenshot.
4. All issues are recorded in the log file, which includes detailed information about the failure, the affected breakpoint, and the screenshot for visual reference.

## Why Choose DECKARD?

By automating these tedious checks, DECKARD saves QA time and helps ensure that web sites remain visually flawless and fully responsive. DECKARD is go-to tool for eliminating inconsistencies before they reach production.
